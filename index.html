<!--  TODO: Add your code -->
<!-- here's how you might structure each project entry on your portfolio page:

    Project Name: Clearly label each project.

    Screenshots/Description: Include visuals and a brief overview of what the project does, 
    technologies used, and any unique features or challenges overcome.

    GitHub Repo Link: Provide a direct link to the GitHub repository for visitors to view the code, 
    read the README for more detailed information, or clone the project. 
    This link is typically to the repository page itself.

    Live Project Link (if applicable): If the project is hosted live (like on PythonAnywhere), 
    include a link to the live site for users to interact with the actual application. -->
